# Hangman-in-Python

This is a simple implemenation of hangman in Python. It simply chooses from a list of words, using the words from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, and the user chooses letters, ya know, like regular hangman.
A little text graphic of a hangman is implemented, just for looks. When the user wins/loses, a corresponding message says so, and then the user
has the option to play again or quit.
Admittedly, it is quite difficult at times to guess the word, since there are over 350,000 words that could be chosen. I may change that later on.
