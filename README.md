# Hangman-in-Python

This is a simple implemenation of hangman in Python. It simply chooses from a list of words, from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, and the user chooses letters, ya know, like regular hangman.
A little text graphic of a hangman is implemented, just for looks. When the user wins/loses, a corresponding message says so, and then the user
has the option to play again or quit.
